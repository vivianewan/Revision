{essay_text}

Evaluate the following 4 criteria out of 10 points each (total 40 points):
1. Spelling – Are words spelled correctly?
2. Grammar – Are verb tenses and sentence structures correct?
3. Language Repertoire – Is vocabulary varied and appropriate?
4. Formulation – Is the text well structured with cohesive devices?

Also, apply a small penalty if the word count is under 150 or over 260 words.

Then:
- Provide brief feedback for each criterion
- Show individual scores and final score out of 40 (after word length penalty)
- Keep the tone constructive and encouraging
